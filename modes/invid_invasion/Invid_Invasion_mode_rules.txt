
This is a timed mode (60 seconds) that starts as a 3 ball multiball with ball saver.

You can add-a-ball by completing the SDF target bank the first time.

The second time you complete the SDF target bank you add 10 seconds to the timer.

Also each spinner hit adds 1 second to timer.

The mode is considered complete when 20 Invid targets are hit.

Once 20 Invid targets hit the ramp will come down for Jackpot shots.

Jackpot values:

Jackpot = (#invid hit * 500) * #balls in play
Double Jackpot = ((#invid hit * 500) * #balls in play) * 2
Super Jackpot = ((#invid hit * 500) * #balls in play) * 3

When the timer is complete the flippers are disabled.

After that you get another skill shot chance.
