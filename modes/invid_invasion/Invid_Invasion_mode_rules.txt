
This is a timed mode (60 seconds) that starts as a 3 ball multiball with ball saver.

You can add-a-ball by completing the SDF target bank the first time.

Also each spinner hit adds 1,2,3,or 4 seconds to timer depending on your current spinner level.

The mode is considered complete when 20 Invid targets are hit.

Once 20 Invid targets hit the ramp will come down for Jackpot shots.

Jackpot values:

Jackpot = (#invid hit * 1000) * ramp_shot_multiplier
Double Jackpot = ((#invid hit * 1000) * 2) * ramp_shot_multiplier
Triple Jackpot = ((#invid hit * 1000) * 3) * ramp_shot_multiplier
Super Jackpot = ((#invid hit * 1000) * 4) * ramp_shot_multiplier

When the timer is complete the flippers are disabled.

After that you get another skill shot chance.
